# Overview
This program was made to demonstrate Java Variables, Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes, ArrayLists, and inheritance.
This program is a simple interactive game similar to the card game Set.
A deck of cards is created, and 12 cards are shown to the player,
who will then select three cards to form a set. This loop is repeated until the large deck runs out off cards.
